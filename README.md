# Canvas
A mini CMS Template built with Gatsby and Strapi. Main purpose to develop this is to provide designers to have a platform showcase and share their designs, like [sketchrepo](https://sketchrepo.com/). For now it just provides a platform with basic functionalities to kickstart your own design blog.

This template is still under active development and below is the roadmap for next one month to make it a CMS with minimal functionality.

## Planned Features
- [x] Basic Blog Template
- [x] Tracking individual file Downloads
- [ ] Implementing Google analytics
- [ ] Adding site wide search
- [ ] Implementing MailChimp to handle subscriptions
- [ ] Migrating away from graphql (Gatsby must be build everytime to reflect the changes in the blog, which adds a limitation from hosting it with github pages. This is to overcome this limitation)
- [ ] Options to add custom menu and pages
- [ ] File Upload Functionality
- [ ] Add functionality to change theme
- [ ] Option to run advertisements

## Page structure
Currently template have 5 page templates, 
1. All
2. Popular
3. Recent
4. About us page
5. Individual file page

## Installation

Though it is built in with designers in mind, it needs to have a basic idea on Strapi as you will be posting blogs from logging into your strapi admin panel, similar to a wordpress blog. So it is good to have basic idea on both Strapi and Gatsby.

### Requirements

1. Install Mongodb
2. Install Strapi
3. Install Gatsby

You are ready to Set things up now!!
